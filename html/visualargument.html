    <h1 id="vaheader">Explanation for High Production Levels</h1>
    <p> The data shows there was the highest production levels of both Arabica coffee and Robusta coffee in the market year 2018/2019. Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Vietnam are the world's highest coffee producing countries. Brazil had a record setting output of Arabica coffee in the market year 2018/19.

    <h3>Biennial Production Cycle</h3>
    <p> Coffee trees, particularly arabica, have a biennial bearing cycle which means they tend to alternate heavy crop and light crop years. This leads to high coffee production levels every other year. 80% of the Brazil-produced Arabica coffee for 2018/2019 market year came from the regions with trees in the on-year of the biennial production cycle. Brazil is predicted to have another high level of production during the 2020/21 market year as it will be another on-year of the biennial production cycle.

    <h3>Favorable Temperatures</h3>
    <p> Arabica coffee grows best in the 18-21 degree Celcius temperature range. Brazil's arabica coffee trees also benefitted from the favorable weather conditions during the blossoming, cherry-setting, and fruit-forming stages. As seen in the graph, all of the top five coffee producing countries had average temperatures that dropped closer to the optimal temperature for growing Arabica coffee during the 2018/19 market year.</p>

    <p>Vietnam's high level of production for the 2018/2019 market year is due to cooler weather and off season rains which helped stimulate coffee trees just before the flowering and cherry setting stages.

    <p> There was a large jump in Robusta coffee production

    <p>I trust that this is a legitimate source because the information is coming straight from the United States Department of Agriculture. This source contains data on coffee exports, imports, production, and consumption from different countries. </p>

    <p> I trust that this is a legitimate source because it comes from a well-known organization that has a list of their complied sources that they used to develop their data. This source contains data on each country's population. The population in a country is important for my data for my project because it is helpful to show exports, imports, production, and consumption in proportion to a country's population. Usually, a country with a larger population will consume more while a country with a smaller population will consume less.</p>

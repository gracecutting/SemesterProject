<h3>Background Information</h3>
<p>I chose to do my semester project about the coffee industry production. I chose this topic because not only do I love to drink coffee but I also enjoy learning about the different aspects of the coffee industry. I enjoyed developing my knowledge of the coffee industry while also putting my new found computer science knowledge to the test in a useful way. </p>
  
<p>This project looks at coffee production during the market years 2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, and 2018/19. I broke down total coffee production into the two main types of coffee: Arabica and Robusta. Arabica makes up the majority of coffee production, approximately seventy percent, and Robusta makes up the other approximately thirty percent. The project displays the data in graphs which show the trends of the varying production levels as well the reasons behind the varying levels. </p>

<p>To look at the graphs I created, click on the "Trends in Graphs" button. For more information on the reasons behind the varying production levels, click on the "Explanation" button. The sources that I used to gather my data can be found by clicking on the "Sources" button.</p>

<h1 id="indexheader">Coffee Industry</h1>

<div id="indexbody">
<p>I chose to do my semester project about the coffee industry production. I chose this topic because not only do I love to drink coffee but I also enjoy learning about the different aspects of the coffee industry. I enjoyed growing my knowledge of the coffee industry while also putting my new found computer science knowledge to use in a real world senario. </p>
  
<p>This project looks at coffee production during the market years 2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, and 2018/19. I broke down total coffee production into the two main types of coffee: Arabica and Robusta. The project displays data that looks at the trends of the varying production levels and the reasons behind the varying levels. </p>

<p>To look at the graphs I created, click on the dashbaord button. For more information on the reasons behind the varying production levels, click on the visual argument button. The sources that I used to gather my data can be found by clicking on the sources button.</p>

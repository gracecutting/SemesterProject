<h1>Coffee Industry</h1>
<p>I chose to do my semester long project about the coffee industry. I chose this topic because not only do I love to drink coffee but I also enjoy learning about the different aspects of the coffee industry. I am excited to grow my knowledge of the coffee industry while also putting my new found computer science knowledge to use in a real world senario. </p>

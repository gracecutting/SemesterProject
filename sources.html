    <h1>Sources</h1>
    <h2>Primary Source</h2>
    <p>“PSD Online.” Apps.Fas.Usda.Gov, 12 June 2020, apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/downloads. Accessed 19 June 2020.
‌   </p>
    <p>I trust that this is a legitimate source because the information is coming straight from the United States Department of Agriculture. This source contains data on coffee exports, imports, production, and consumption from different countries. </p>
    <h2>Supporting Source</h2>
    <h4>Country Populations</h4>
    <p>“Population, Total | Data.” Worldbank.Org, 2019, data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL. 
‌   </p>
    <p> I trust that this is a legitimate source because it comes from a well-known organization that has a list of their complied sources that they used to develop their data. This source contains data on each country's population. The population in a country is important for my data for my project because it is helpful to show exports, imports, production, and consumption in proportion to a country's population. Usually, a country with a larger population will consume more while a country with a smaller population will consume less.</p>
